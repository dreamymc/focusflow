# FocusFlow — Agentic Orchestration File
> Read this file COMPLETELY before taking any action. It is your operating manual.

## 🧠 Project Identity

**FocusFlow** is a multi-tenant team productivity SaaS built in Laravel 11.
It is the primary portfolio project for a summer internship applicant.
Every architectural decision should be explainable in an interview.
Code must be production-quality: clean, tested, documented.

**Stack:** Laravel 11 · PHP 8.3 · PostgreSQL · Redis · Laravel Reverb (WebSockets)
· Laravel Horizon · Laravel Cashier (Stripe) · Sanctum · Pest PHP · Inertia.js + Vue 3

**GitHub:** `git init` on first run · commit after every completed phase task.

## 📚 Skills — Load Before Coding

> **🚨 CRITICAL MEMORY REMINDER: DO NOT IGNORE THIS 🚨**
> You have dozens of powerful GLOBAL SKILLS installed in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/`.
> BEFORE taking ANY action, you **MUST** run the `using-superpowers` skill to evaluate what global skills apply.
> If fixing a bug or test: you **MUST** use `systematic-debugging` before guessing.
> If finishing a task: you **MUST** use `requesting-code-review` via a subagent.
> If auditing before push: you **MUST** use `codebase-audit-pre-push`.
> **Violating this rule is considered a total failure.**

Before writing ANY project code, load the relevant project-specific skill. Skills are in `.agents/skills/`.

| Task | Load Skill |
|------|------------|
| Any Laravel PHP work | `.agents/skills/laravel-conventions.md` |
| Writing tests | `.agents/skills/pest-tdd.md` |
| API routes/resources | `.agents/skills/api-design.md` |
| WebSockets / Reverb | `.agents/skills/websockets-reverb.md` |
| Stripe / billing | `.agents/skills/stripe-cashier.md` |
| Any auth/security work | `.agents/skills/security.md` |

**Rule:** Never generate a file without the matching skill loaded. Never assume you don't need a global skill. This is non-negotiable.

## 🤖 Sub-Agent Routing Rules

Antigravity spawns subagents dynamically. Specify the role and context inline (e.g. backend-engineer, tdd-engineer) instead of using static agent files.

### Parallel Dispatch — ALL conditions must be met:
- 3+ tasks that touch **completely different files/domains**
- No shared database schema changes pending
- No env configuration changes mid-flight
- Each task has a clear, isolated success condition

### Sequential Dispatch — ANY condition triggers:
- Task B needs output, schema, or artifact from Task A
- Both tasks write to the same file
- A migration must run before a model can be used
- Scope is unclear — understand first, then build

### Background Dispatch:
- Documentation writing while implementation continues
- Security audits that don't block the build
- Codebase analysis and research tasks

**Invocation quality rule:** Never send a sub-agent vague instructions.
Every dispatch must include: (1) exact files involved, (2) expected output, (3) success criteria.

Bad: `"Implement authentication"`
Good: `"Implement email/password registration in app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisterController.php
using Sanctum tokens. Output: controller, FormRequest, test in tests/Feature/Auth/RegisterTest.php.
Success: all tests pass, token returned in JSON response."`

## 🔁 Loop Engineering

This project is built with **loops, not one-shot prompts**.

### The TDD Loop (use for every feature):
```
1. tdd-engineer writes tests → tests MUST fail first
2. Commit failing tests: git commit -m "test: [feature] red"
3. backend-engineer implements until green
4. Commit: git commit -m "feat: [feature] green"
5. code-reviewer reviews → fixes → re-review
6. Commit: git commit -m "refactor: [feature] clean"
7. Loop exits when: all tests pass + reviewer approves
```

### The Phase Loop (macro loop for each build phase):
```
1. architect reviews phase spec → outputs ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
2. Spawn parallel sub-agents for independent tasks (if routing rules allow)
3. Sequential sub-agents for dependent tasks
4. tdd-engineer writes integration tests for the whole phase
5. security-auditor reviews anything touching auth/billing/API
6. All tests pass → phase complete → update PLAN.md status
7. git tag: v0.X.0-phase-N
```

### Loop Exit Conditions (NEVER skip these):
- ✅ `php artisan test` exits 0
- ✅ No `dd()`, `var_dump()`, or debug code in committed files
- ✅ `php artisan route:list` shows no orphaned routes
- ✅ `php artisan ide-helper:generate` runs clean
- ✅ code-reviewer sub-agent has approved the diff

### Runaway Loop Prevention:
- Max 3 retries on any single failing test before escalating to user
- If a sub-agent task exceeds 15 minutes without a commit, STOP and report
- Never mutate the database schema mid-phase without a backup migration plan

## 🪄 Native Subagent Orchestration

You no longer need to open multiple manual terminal windows. Antigravity can natively spawn parallel workers using the `invoke_subagent` tool. All work is coordinated from the single Orchestrator session.

### How to split work safely:

**The Orchestrator (Main Session)** — Reads GEMINI.md and dispatches tasks:
- Uses `invoke_subagent` to spawn specialized agents (e.g., `tdd-engineer`, `backend-engineer`).
- Each subagent runs in the background.
- The Orchestrator waits for their completion messages, merges the work, and runs tests.

### Parallel-safe rules:
- **Never** spawn two subagents that modify migrations simultaneously.
- **Never** spawn two subagents that modify `.env` or `config/` simultaneously.
- **Always** assign strictly non-overlapping file paths to each subagent in their Prompt.
- The Orchestrator is responsible for running `php artisan test` after subagents complete to verify integration.

### Recommended Subagent Splits by Phase:

| Phase | Subagent 1 | Subagent 2 | Subagent 3 |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| Phase 2 | Workspace CRUD + migrations | Task model + API | Pest tests for both |
| Phase 3 | Reverb channels setup | Frontend Echo setup | WebSocket integration tests |
| Phase 4 | Slack integration | Stripe billing | Tests + security audit |
